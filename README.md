## Aim

Our project aims at providing a platform for users where they can know what their friends are reading and exchange books with them, along with knowing which book is the talk of the town, and we mean it literally. Our project will provide users the service of knowing what is the most read and exchanged books in their desired radius. This is what we mean by knowing what is the talk of the town. In the future, we want our project to be used by people ranging from hardcore bibliophiles searching for a book they want to read in their locality to university students searching for other students for exchanging their course books. Our horizon is not limited as we want to reach each and every one.

Softwares-Required: Flutter Sdk Android Studio/VS Code

Visit here to know how to install the mentioned requirements. It is flutter team's official docs over the installation. Also, you can check here for more info.

Start-Contributing: Step 1: Fork this repository A fork would place a copy of this project in your GitHub Account Fork

Step 2: Clone the repository Cloning the repository will place a local copy of project on your own machine

Copy the URL from the copy to clipboard icon

Copy To Clipboard

Open a terminal and run the following git command :

git clone https://github.com//Flutter-UI.git

Step 3: Create a branch A branch is a way to keep your changes separate from the main part of the project called Master. For example if things go wrong and you are not happy with your changes you can simply delete the branch and the main project won't be affected. Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

cd Flutter-UI

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

git checkout -b

(While the branch name can be anything we suggest you to keep it the way we mentioned.)

Step 4: Make necessary changes and commit Open the project in Android Studio or VS Code. Make sure you are not on master branch.

A schema of the different models used in the app is shared here(the link will be there). We are using Firebase to store information. Select any one of the issue that we have created and follow the instructions there and after you have finally solved the problem.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:

git add .

Now commit those changes using the git commit command:

git commit -m " Profile Card Added"

Step 5: Push Changes Push your changes using the command git push origin
